## Broker Support Roadmap

Due to the overwhelming variety of how broker APIs structure their data (and how they make it available), there is a wide variety of how much support we can provide out-of-the-box for different brokers, summarized in this table:

| Broker                | Black-Scholes | Greeks | Open Interest Based Exposures | Options-Book Based Exposures | Implied PDF Calculations |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Tradier (via WebSocket) | ✅           | ✅     | ✅                            | ✅                           | Coming soon                        |

Ideally all aspects of `floe` will be available for all brokers, but this will take time to determine as we work through the various data structures and formats that each broker provides.

## Unsupported Brokers

The following brokers have no public API:

- Fidelity
- Robinhood

If your broker is not listed above, you can still use `floe` by normalizing your broker's data structures to match the expected input types. With options, you can get quite far with `floe` just by having the market price for the underlying and each option. (From those alone you can back out the IV, greeks, and exposures.)
